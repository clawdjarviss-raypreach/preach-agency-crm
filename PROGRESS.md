# Dashboard v0 — Process Log

(Autoupdated by Jarvis. Goal: quick proof-of-work + continuity.)

## 2026-02-05

### 00:45 (Europe/Madrid)
- Scaffolded the new CRM app (`projects/dashboard-v0/app/crm`) with Next.js + Tailwind.
- Added Prisma + SQLite, implemented the initial schema (users/creators/shifts/payroll/bonuses/KPIs/sync logs).
- Ran the first migration and created the local DB (`dev.db`).
- Documented storage conventions (money=cents, time=minutes).

### 2026-02-05 01:23 (Europe/Madrid)
- Progress-log automation: discovered the cron was set to wake on next heartbeat (so it didn’t fire while you were asleep).
- Fix: switching to an isolated cron agent that appends updates autonomously (no heartbeat needed).
- Next up: seed script + basic role-gated pages (Users/Creators/Assignments/Shifts).

### 2026-02-05 01:31 (Europe/Madrid)
- Heartbeats enabled: wrote minimal checklist into HEARTBEAT.md (health + progress continuity + comms discipline).
- Starting next build step now: implement Prisma seed + dev-only login + first CRUD pages scaffolding.

### 2026-02-05 01:33 (Europe/Madrid)
- Seeded CRM DB successfully (admin/supervisor/chatter demo users + demo creator + assignment).
- Prisma fixed for local dev: pinned Prisma to v6.x and reset dev.db cleanly so seeds/migrations run reliably.
- Next: add a simple dev-login page + role-gated sidebar so you can click around immediately.

### 2026-02-05 01:46 (Europe/Madrid)
